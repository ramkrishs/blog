Such a warm day I just told Srikanth fomer Microsoft Student Partnet that i got selected as Microsoft Student Partner. He was happy and wanted me to inform my head of department, so following day I went and informed my our HOD (CSE) Prof.S.Chitra what's Microsoft Student partner program is about and I was the first computer science student to in my college to be part of it since Srikanth was basically from Electrical Engineering background. Immediately she congratulated me. Later in that week I kick started to take a session on Windows 7 which is new Microsoft OS. Next thing is that I got permission from HOD. I was tensed coz this was my first session.I got prepared with my presentation and  I brought my laptop with Window 7 RC preinstalled in it, so that I can teach them  all features available in it. It’s around 3'o clock i got the key to the conference hall key from staff and made some arrangements and all set to go.

We have conducted a session on WINDOWS 7 AND IE8 at our campus. My college old MSP Mr.Srikanth formally introduced me as new MSP of our college the function was presided over by our principal Dr.Valavan, our HOD (CSE) Prof.S.Chitra, and our campus coordinator Ms.V.Banupriya. It started with a welcome address by Mr.Pradheep, president, Microsoft campus club.

I made a hands on session on topic “WINDOWS 7 “ and a presentation on “IE8” was took by Mr.kathiravan,Vice-president of the club, around 95 students from various department have attended the program. All the participants enjoyed the cool videos and the session.
